This repository contains some of the programs I wrote for my Computer Networks course.

### Line-Coding Schemes.cpp
This file contains implementation of line coding schemes namely: NRZ, NRZ-L, NRZ-I, RZ, Manchester, Differential Manchester, AMI, Pseudoternary, 2B1Q.

### Error-detection-and-correcrion-algorithms.cs
This file contains implementation of famous error detection and correction algorithms in Computer Networks, namely: Parity bit check, 2d Parity bit check, Hamming algorithm, CRC and Checksum.
